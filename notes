There are 4 courses

----Course 1 ----

Week 1 - Introduction

Merge sort analysis:
Use recursion tree, consider 
  1. the max number of levels of the tree
  2. at each level, what is the number of subproblems and what's the size of each subproblem
  3. how many operations outside the recursive call (is the merging for merge sort)
  
Analysis of algorithm:
  fast algorithm = worst case running time grows slowly with the input size
Holy Grail: linear running time(or close to it)

Week 2 - Asymptotic analysis

High level idea:
  to suppress constant factors and lower order terms
