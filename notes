There are 4 courses

----Course 1 ----

Week 1 - Introduction

Merge sort analysis:
Use recursion tree, consider 
  1. the max number of levels of the tree
  2. at each level, what is the number of subproblems and what's the size of each subproblem
  3. how many operations outside the recursive call (is the merging for merge sort)
  
Analysis of algorithm:
  fast algorithm = worst case running time grows slowly with the input size
Holy Grail: linear running time(or close to it)

Week 2 - Asymptotic analysis

High level idea:
  to suppress constant factors and lower order terms
  
Week 4 
 
Chapter 10 - graph and contraction algorithm 
  due to kargal in early 90S
  
 For single round of this algorithm the sucessful rate is >= 1/(N^2), very low. 
 proof:(make use of following)
  1. every cut(contracted cut) has at least k edges.
  2. sum of the degree of all vertices = 2 * #all edges
 
Solution: run the basic a large numbe of times, remember the smallest cut.
running time O(n^2 m).
with better ideas,can improve to around O(n^2)
